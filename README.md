## Introduction

GitExtensions is a standalone Git repository tool, a Visual Studio 2008 / 2010 / 2012 / 2013 add-in and a shell extension.

JetBrains Fork adds a few features which have not been taken into the main project yet:
* OpenSSH keys wizard — user interface for generating SSH keys and setting them up for the first use
* OpenSSH interactive prompt fix — as the terminal is fully functional for git/ssh commands, prompts are operational
* Shallow Clone — don't download full history of a large repo
* Sparse Checkout — don't write out all of the repo files into the working copy
* Console Emulator — git commands are run in a real embedded terminal, which allows them to be fully operational; the main window also has a terminal
* Performance fixes for repos with large history
* Minor fixes
